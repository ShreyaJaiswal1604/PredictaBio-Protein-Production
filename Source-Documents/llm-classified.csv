EGF,recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy: another negative sepsis trial?,"Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by an unbalanced host response to an infection resulting in organ dysfunction.1 Sepsis is associated with activation of the coagulation system, and 30% to 60% of patients have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).2 Fulminant DIC is characterized by` activation of the coagulation system combined with an impaired function of endogenous anticoagulant mechanisms resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and concurrent hemorrhage secondary to consumption of clotting factors and platelets.3,4 Strong and bimodal interactions exist between coagulation and inflammation, wherein coagulation factors enhance inflammation and vice versa.4 Observational studies suggest a link between the severity of coagulopathy, organ dysfunction, and death in patients with sepsis. In addition, in several preclinical sepsis models, inhibition of coagulation reduces both systemic inflammation and mortality.3,4 These findings led to large randomized trials of several anticoagulant agents in patients with sepsis, most notably recombinant human activated protein C (APC), tissue factor pathway inhibitors, and antithrombin.5 None of these interventions improved survival, with the exception of APC in the PROWESS trial and those results were not upheld by subsequent trials.5 In this issue of JAMA, Vincent and colleagues report the long-awaited results of the SCARLET (Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin) phase 3 trial.6 SCARLET was designed to determine the effect of another anticoagulant, soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin (ART-123), on 28-day mortality in patients with sepsisassociated coagulopathy and concomitant cardiovascular failure, respiratory failure, or both. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the primary end point of 28-day allcause mortality, raising the question of why the study was conducted given prior results with other anticoagulants. The answer is somewhat nuanced, but, in short, thrombomodulin has a different mode of action that offers important theoretical advantages. The soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin evaluated in this study is composed of the extracellular portion of the transmembrane receptor thrombomodulin, which entails a C-type lectin domain and a region with 6 epidermal growth factor–like repeats.7 The epidermal growth factor–like repeats express a high-affinity binding site for the central coagulation protease thrombin. Thrombin complexed with thrombomodulin cannot cleave fibrinogen or activate factor V or factor XIII but rather accelerates the conversion from protein C to APC, a potent anticoagulant by virtue of its capacity to inactivate clotting factors Va and VIIIa.7 Thus, soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin has 2 anticoagulant modes of action: direct, through inhibition of the procoagulant activity of thrombin, and indirect by promoting protein C activation. In addition, after binding by thrombomodulin, thrombin is unable to cleave protease-activated receptor-1 or -3 on cells, thereby losing its proinflammatory properties. Thrombin-thrombomodulin also accelerates the activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, which inhibits fibrinolysis and inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a.7 Independent of thrombin binding, the C-type lectin-like domain of thrombomodulin has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects, including inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and nuclear factor-κ activation, impediment of adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, and inhibition of high-mobility group box 1 protein, an alarmin implicated in sepsis pathogenesis.7 The C-type lectin domain can also impede the binding of lipopolysaccharide, the proinflammatory component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, to its receptor CD14, thereby mitigating cell activation. Thus, thrombomodulin has multiple anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects that could, theoretically, be beneficial in patients with sepsis. Consistently, preclinical studies have documented favorable effects of soluble thrombomodulin in experimental sepsis associated with improvements of coagulation abnormalities, inflammation, and organ dysfunction.8 The first clinical indication that recombinant thrombomodulin might be a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with sepsis came from a phase 3 trial conducted in Japan of 227 patients with DIC secondary to hematologic malignancy or infection.9 In this study, the effects of recombinant thrombomodulin were compared with heparin using resolution of DIC as a primary end point.9 DIC was resolved in 66.1% of patients in the recombinant thrombomodulin group compared with 49.9% of patients in the heparin group, but there was no effect on the secondary end point of mortality (21.9% vs 25.7%). These data led to the registration of recombinant thrombomodulin (ART-123) for the Related article Opinion",NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,MAYBE,NO,NO,MAYBE,NO,Yes,NO
EGF,targeting tumor cells via egf receptors: selective toxicity of an hbegf‐toxin fusion protein,"Over‐expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of numerous solid tumors, thus providing a means of selectively targeting therapeutic agents. Heparin‐binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF) binds to EGFRs with high affinity and to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in increased mitogenic potential compared to other EGF family members. We have investigated the feasibility of using HBEGF to selectively deliver a cytotoxic protein into EGFR‐expressing tumor cells.<0B> <0R>Recombinant fusion proteins consisting of mature human HBEGF fused to the plant ribosome‐inactivating protein saporin (SAP) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified HBEGF‐SAP chimeras inhibited protein synthesis in a cell‐free assay and competed with EGF for binding to receptors on intact cells. A construct with a 22‐amino‐acid flexible linker (L22) between the HBEGF and SAP moieties exhibited an affinity for the EGFR that was comparable to that of HBEGF. The sensitivity to HBEGF‐L22‐SAP was determined for a variety of human tumor cell lines, including the 60 cell lines comprising the National Cancer Institute Anticancer Drug Screen. HBEGF‐L22‐SAP was cytotoxicin vitro to a variety of EGFR‐bearing cell lines and inhibited growth of EGFR‐over‐expressing human breast carcinoma cellsin vivo. In contrast, the fusion protein had no effect on small‐cell lung carcinoma cells, which are EGFR‐deficient. Our results demonstrate that fusion proteins composed of HBEGF and SAP exhibit targeting specificity and cytotoxicity that may be of therapeutic value in treating a variety of EGFR‐bearing malignancies.

EGF,ras effector loop mutations that dissociate p120gap and neurofibromin interactions,"ras proteins are positively regulated by nucleotide exchange factors and negatively regulated by GTPase‐activating proteins (GAPs). Two GAPs have been found in mammalian cells, p120GAP and neurofibromin, the product of the type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene. A library of substitutions in the effector loop region of ras in an Escherichia coli plasmid expression system was screened for c‐Ha‐ras species with altered GAP interactions. Several substitutions preferentially disrupted the interaction of ras with p120GAP as compared with the interaction with the recombinant GAP‐related domain of neurofibromin (NF1‐GRD). The most extreme example, Tyr32His, encoded a ras species that was unaffected by p120GAP but was stimulated normally by NF1‐GRD. Tyr32His was weakly transforming in Rat2 cells. Tyr32His ras was primarily GDP‐bound in quiescent Rat2 cells, although it rapidly associated with GTP after treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor. These results show that the NF1 product has less stringent requirements than p120GAP for ras effector domain structure and that negative regulation of ras can be achieved in rat fibroblasts by the product of NF1. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,MAYBE,NO,NO,YES,YES,Yes,NO
EGF,the molecular basis of touch sensation as modeled in caenorhabditis elegans,"One of the looming mysteries in signal transduction today is the question of how mechanical signals, such as pressure or stretch, are sensed. Elegant electrophysiological studies in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals support that mechanotransduction can be mediated by ion channels that gate in response to mechanical stimuli. Despite the importance of the molecular identification of these ion channels for elaborating mechanisms of mechanotransduction, genes encoding mechanosensitive ion channels eluded cloning efforts for a long time. Breakthroughs in the understanding of mechanosensitive channels have come from genetic analyses of touch sensation in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, screens for touch-insensitive mutants identified two genes, mec-4 and mec-10, that encode channel subunits implicated in touch sensation and are postulated to be the core of a mechanotransducing ion channel complex. mec-4 and mec-10 encode proteins with similarity to subunits of the mammalian amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na channel (ENaC) that mediates sodium reabsorption in the kidney and lung. mec-4 is expressed exclusively in six neurons that laser ablation studies have identified as gentle-touch receptors, and mec-10 is expressed in these six neurons plus two pairs of touch receptors that are thought to sense harsher touch. The same genetic screens that identified mec-4 and mec-10 identified other genes required for normal touch sensation in the nematode. MEC-5, a novel collagen, and MEC-9, a protein that includes multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitor repeats and EGF repeats, are extracellular matrix proteins that may interact with MEC-4/MEC-10 channel subunits on the extracellular side of the neuron to help exert gating tension on the channel. Inside the touch receptor, a specialized cytoskeleton is assembled that features 15-protofilament microtubules composed of MEC-12 a-tubulin and MEC-7 b-tubulin subunits. This cytoskeleton may be linked to tether MEC-4/MEC-10 on the intracellular side. When a mutant hyperactivated MEC-4(d) subunit is heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, voltage-independent Na currents are produced that can be modulated in both amplitude and properties by two other proteins also identified by genetic screens as required for touch transduction: MEC-2, a stomatin-like protein, and Transduction Channels in Sensory Cells.

EGF,glycoprotein oligosaccharides as recognition structures.,"A series of observations--the pronounced changes in the expression and distribution of oligosaccharide antigens during embryonic development, cell differentiation and oncogenesis, the prominence of these changing structures (oncodevelopmental antigens) on the receptor for epidermal growth factor, and the stimulation of receptor autophosphorylation following their perturbation with antibodies--has suggested that the oligosaccharides of growth factor receptors and complementary lectins may be intimately involved in molecular recognition events in growth and differentiation processes. For elucidating oligosaccharide recognition by diverse cellular and secreted proteins and microbial adhesins, a new technique has been developed which involves the overlay of immobilized oligosaccharide probes (neoglycolipids) derived from glycoproteins and other sources. New insights have been gained into carbohydrate recognition by several mammalian lectins, and a novel receptor system has been discovered in Escherichia coli isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. This new technique seems ideal for elucidating oligosaccharide recognition in diverse biological settings, and for 'quality control' of the sugar chains of recombinant glycoproteins engineered for the purpose of administration to man.",NO,,YES,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,MAYBE,Yes,NO
EGF,engineered multifunctional artificial dermis for infected burn wound healing,"Burn wound healing is a dynamic and interconnected process, with the complex status of the extracellular matrix (ECM) potentially leading to bacterial infections, drug resistance, or even fatality. However, it remains a grand challenge to assemble a skin‐like material showing similar biological properties as healthy ECM to accelerate burn healing. In this study, the ECM composition is closely mimicked and adaptive multifunctional artificial dermis is developed by leveraging Ag─S bonds, supramolecular interactions among recombinant proteins, Ag+, and hyaluronic acid (HA). The artificial dermis exhibits long‐lasting broad‐spectrum antibacterial activity, achieved though controlled Ag+ release via Ag─S bonds, supramolecular interactions, and recombinant protein‐guided multi‐level assembly, reaching a steady plateau of 83.7% in the later stage. It is found that inflammation is reduced by downregulating IL‐6 and TGF‐β expression. Furthermore, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) within the recombinant proteins stimulates Col1α, ELN, and CD31 upregulation, facilitating ECM remodeling. These adaptive multifunctional artificial dermis effectively address wound infections, accelerate collagen deposition, promote re‐epithelialization, and enhance angiogenesis in infected wounds, highlighting their potential to revolutionize burn wound treatment and offering a promising avenue to holistic care.",MAYBE,YES,YES,Yes,YES,NO,MAYBE,YES,NO,MAYBE,MAYBE,Yes,NO
EGF,multifunctional double‐layer and dual drug‐loaded microneedle patch promotes diabetic wound healing,"Chronic nonhealing diabetic wounds are a serious complication of diabetes, with a high morbidity rate that can cause disability or death. The long period of inflammation and dysfunctional angiogenesis are the main reasons for wound‐healing difficulty in diabetes. In this study, a multifunctional double‐layer microneedle (DMN) is constructed to control infection and promote angiogenesis, meeting the multiple demands of the healing process of a diabetic wound. The double‐layer microneedle is consisted in a hyaluronic acid substrate and a mixture of carboxymethyl chitosan and gelatin as the tip. The antibacterial drug tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) is loaded into the substrate of the microneedle to achieve rapid sterilization and promote resistance to external bacterial infections. The microneedle tip loaded with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rh‐EGF) is inserted into the skin, in response to gelatinase produced by resident microbe and disassociate to achieve the enzymatic response release. The double‐layer drug‐loaded microneedles (DMN@TH/rh‐EGF) have antibacterial and antioxidant effects, and promote cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro. In an in vivo diabetic wound model, using rats, the DMN@TH/rh‐EGF patch is able to inhibit inflammation, promote angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration during the wound healing process, promoting its healing.",MAYBE,NO,NO,Yes,NO,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO,Yes,NO

EGF,mass production of human epidermal growth factor using fed‐batch cultures of recombinant escherichia coli,"Fed‐batch cultures of recombinant E. coli HB101 harboring expression plasmid pTRLBT1 or pTREBT1, with acetate concentration monitoring, are investigated to obtain high cell density and large amounts of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF). The expression plasmid pTRlBT1 contains a synthetic hEGF gene attached downstream of the N‐terminal fragment of the trp L gene preceded by the trp promoter. The expression plasmid pTREBT1 contains the same coding sequence attached downstream of the N‐terminal fragment of the trp E gene preceded by the trp promoter, trp L gene, and attenuator region. E. coli harboring pTREBT1 produces 0.56 mg/L hEGE and immediately degrades it. On the other hand E. coli harboring pTRLBT1 produces 6.8 mg/L hEGF and does not decompose it. Prominent inclusion bodies are observed in E. coli cells harboring pTRLBT1 using an election microscope. To Cultivate E. coli harboring pTRLBT1, a fed‐batch culture system, divided into a cell growth step and an hEGF production step, is carried out. The cells grow smoothly without acetate‐induced inhibition.

EGF,in vivo chemoenzymatic control of n‐terminal processing in recombinant human epidermal growth factor,"Protein synthesis initiates with Met in the cytosol of eukaryotes and formylmethionine (fMet) in prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles. N-terminal methionine excision (NME) is the major source of N-terminal amino acid diversity in all three life kingdoms. The excision is dictated by the nature and bulkiness of the side-chain of the second amino acid (the penultimate residue) and is catalyzed by methionylaminopeptidases (MetAPs; EC 3.4.11.18). In bacteria, Lys, Arg, Leu, Phe and Ile protect the N-terminal Met from removal, whereas Met excision is promoted by having Gly, Ala, Pro, Cys, Ser, Thr or Val as the penultimate residues (Scheme 1A). NME is an irreversible cotranslational proteolysis, and is completed before the nascent polypeptide chains are fully synthesized. It was recently estimated that between 55 and 70% of the proteins of any given proteome undergo this Met excision. The canonical amino acid, Met is recognized, activated and charged onto its cognate tRNAs by methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS). The N-formyl group from the initiator, methionine is enzymatically removed from the nascent polypeptide in bacteria. This is an essential prerequisite for the co-translational action of MetAP. E. coli MetRS exhibits remarkable flexibility in its substrate binding and tRNA charging—a fact that we and others have used for in vivo incorporation of a large number of Met analogues and Met-like amino acids (surrogates) into polypeptide sequences. The chemical diversification of Met side-chains that can be achieved in this way is quite impressive; it ranges from aliphatic, chalcogen and halogen-containing side-chains, to unsaturated chemical groups like alkenes or alkynes and other interesting bioorthogonal groups such as azides. 10] Previously, Tirrell and co-workers demonstrated nearly quantitative substitution of the Met residues in dihydrofolate reduct ACHTUNGTRENNUNGase by homopropargylglycine (Hpg). The initiator Met was also substituted, but the Hpg in the first position was not excised. Similarly, we globally replaced Met with trifluoromethionine in green fluorescent protein and discovered an efficient blockage of the N-terminal excision of trifluoro-Met when Ser was the penultimate residue. Based on these observations we reasoned that the incorporation of different Met analogues at the protein’s N-terminus would enable us to change the NME rules in recombinant proteins. We chose to study the effects of azidohomoalanine (Aha) and Hpg (Scheme 1B), whose chemically unique azido and alkyne sidechains, respectively, have recently gained great importance for bioorthogonal transformations. In order to test the catalytic efficiency of MetAP towards these analogues, we prepared a series of pentapeptides that contain Met, Hpg or Aha as N-terminal amino acids with Arg or Gly in the second position (penultimate residues). While Arg, which is a bulky penultimate residue, was expected to efficiently block excision of the N-terminal residues, Gly is the smallest amino acid and should support NME. Expectedly, the overnight incubation of Arg2 pentapeptides (Met1-Arg2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; Aha1-Arg2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; and Hpg1-Arg2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5) with recombinant E. coli MetAP yielded no cleavage of Met, Aha or Hpg from the peptides (data not shown). That means that the excision was blocked completely by having Arg in the second position. On the other hand, the excision of Met, Aha and Hpg was observed in the case of Gly2 pentapeptides (Met1-Gly2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; Aha1Gly2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; and Hpg1-Gly2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5). The canonical amino acid Met was fully cleaved after 10 min, but complete excision of Aha and Hpg was observed only after 100 and 250 min, respectively (Figure 1). Although Aha and Hpg are less efficiently processed than Met in Gly2 pentapepACHTUNGTRENNUNGtides, they are indeed substrates for E. coli MetAP. Nonetheless, the main differences are found in the excision kinetics. These allowed us to identify the following order of the in vitro cleavage efficiency in Gly2 pentapeptides: Met>Aha>Hpg. Interestingly, the Aha-pentapeptide was better processed by the E. coli MetAP than the Hpg-pentapeptide, but we observed the opposite with MetAP from Pyrococcus furiosus (unpub[a] L. Merkel, Dr. Yu.

EGF,"identification of epidermal growth factor (egf), in an unknown pharmaceutical preparation suspected to contain insulin like growth factor 1 (igf-1).","The last 30years are marked by a tremendous evolution in the comprehension of human physiology. Although many physiological processes remain enigmatic, our increased understanding has led to a considerable development of medicines. A small, but yet a more progressively important sub fraction of this drug market consists of recombinant proteins and peptides. Although in most western countries a prescription is required for the injection of these compounds, some of them can easily be acquired from illicit internet pharmacies whether or not disguised as ‘research companies’. Some of these drugs can not only be used to cure ourselves but also to improve our sports performance, deepen our tan, and strive to the ideals imposed by society. Reports originating from controlling agencies residing in Germany, the UK, Denmark, Norway, Italy, the USA, Australia, and Belgium show that monoclonal anti‐cancer antibodies, insulins, growth hormones, human chorionic gonadotropin, Clostridium botulinum toxin type A, potential doping peptides, putative anti‐obesity drugs, skin tanning peptides, neuropeptides and a putative anti‐cancer polypeptide were identified in seized samples. The danger of these illegal polypeptides resides in the fact that these polypeptide products are not produced under controlled environment and therefore may contain the wrong ingredient, the wrong dosage, bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, etc., which could result in severe health issues. In some cases these illegal acts had a deadly outcome. Furthermore, for many of these polypeptide drugs, there is a limited knowledge of their effects and/or side‐effects (long and short term) hence clinical studies have not been terminated or even worse were given a negative advice due to overall potential adverse health effects. Global actions are on‐going to protect the sometimes unaware public from these malignant activities. In Belgium, the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP) is responsible for this task and upon their request unknown pharmaceutical preparations suspected to contain illegal drugs are regularly subject to analysis in our official medicines control laboratory (OMCL). At the end of 2014, an unknown pharmaceutical preparation, claimed to contain insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1) was submitted for analysis by immunoblotting against IGF‐1 and analogues, prior to liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS). Based on the interpretation of the western blot and the LC‐MS data we were not able to identify this substance as being any form of insulin like growth factor (IGF), including IGF‐1, IGF‐2 or synthetic analogues potentially used as doping agent. Further analysis by LC‐MS/MS and subsequent peptide sequencing showed that the substance present in the sample corresponds to epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF plays a major role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and is therefore frequently used in cell culture. This polypeptide, consisting of 53 amino acids, with sequence NSDSECPLSHDGYCLHDGVCMYIEALDKYACNCVVGYIGERCQYRDLKWWELR and 3 intramolecular disulfide bonds has an average Molecular weight of 6215.9Da. This polypeptide is known to interact with the EGF‐receptor (EGFR) and can promote tumour cell motility and invasion. Therefore the blocking of EGF binding to the EGFR and further downstream signalling pathway is currently marked as a target for anti‐cancer therapy for certain cancers (reviewed in Yewale et al.). Indeed, a vaccine targeting EGF, named CimaVax‐EGF, results in the production of antibodies directed against EGF and this vaccine is being used as cancer therapy against non‐small‐cell lung carcinoma in Cuba. The CimaVax vaccine consists of recombinant EGF chemically conjugated to the protein P64K from Neisseria meningitides. It induces the production of antibodies directed against EGF and results in the prevention of EGF to attach to EGFR and thus inhibiting the signal that tells cancer cells to grow and divide. Nowadays, the product is undergoing further trials for possible licensing in Europe and the United States. Although no injectable legal medicine is available on the market, the product is used in the cosmetic industry. It is thought that the topical application of EGF would enhance wound healing and stimulate skin rejuvenation. Taken together, we believe that the purchaser was unaware of the presence of EGF in the sample. This case of potential dangerous wrong labelling clearly demonstrates the peril of purchasing potential doping agents via the black market.",NO,NO,NO,Yes,NO,,MAYBE,YES,NO,MAYBE,NO,Yes,NO
EGF,egf receptor and p185erbb‐2‐specific single‐chain antibody toxins differ in their cell‐killing activity on tumor cells expressing both receptor proteins,"Many human tumors over‐express erbB‐2 and EGF receptors. The membrane localization of these receptor tyrosine kinases make them appropriate targets for directed tumor therapy. We have used recombinant DNA technology to produce single‐chain antibody exotoxin A (scFv‐ETA) fusion proteins which specifically bind the erbB‐2 and EGF receptors. The scFv portion is composed of the heavy‐ and light‐chain variable domains of monoclonal antibodies which recognize the extracellular portion of each receptor. We have previously described the anti‐tumor activity of the bacterially produced scFv(FRP5)‐ETA directed to the erbB‐2 receptor. In this paper we describe the characteristics of scFv(225)‐ETA, a protein which binds the EGF receptor. The bacterially produced recombinant protein binds to the receptor with high affinity and inhibits the in vitro growth of the EGF receptor over‐expressing tumor cell lines A431 and MDA‐MB468. Combination treatment with scFv‐(FRPS)‐ETA and scFv(225)‐ETA led to an additive inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of A431 cells. SKBR3 cells expressing low levels of EGF receptor but high levels of p 185erbB‐2 were not affected by scFv(225)‐ETA treatment but were sensitive to scFv(FRP5)‐ETA. Stimulation of SKBR3 cells and HCII RI#11 mouse mammary epithelial cells expressing the human erbB‐2 with EGF led to an increase in scFv(FRP5)‐ETA activity, showing that the EGF‐induced activation of erbB‐2 can potentiate the action of the erbB‐2‐directed toxin. Treatment of athymic nude mice with scFv(FRP5)‐ETA and the combination of both scFv‐ETA proteins led to the transient arrest of growth of established A431 tumors. scFv(22S)‐ETA treatment alone was the most effective, leading to tumor shrinkage during the course of treatment, whereas treatment with the parental monoclonal antibody 225 led to retarded tumor growth. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,Yes,YES

The treatment of these wounds requires a higher payload of growth factors. With this in mind, the strategy for this study was to utilize a novel payload comprising of Eudragit RL/RS 100 nanofibers carrying the bacterial inhibitor gentamicin sulfate (GS) in concert with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF); an accelerator of wound healing. GS containing Eudragit was electrospun to yield nanofiber scaffolds, which were further modified by covalent immobilization of rhEGF to their surface. This novel fabricated nanoscaffold was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The thermal behavior of the nanoscaffold was determined using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. In the in vitro antibacterial assays, the nanoscaffolds exhibited comparable antibacterial activity to pure gentemicin powder. In vivo work using female C57/BL6 mice, the nanoscaffolds induced faster wound healing activity in dorsal wounds compared to the control.

EGF,calcium‐ and ph‐dependent localization of annexin a6 isoforms in balb/3t3 fibroblasts reflecting their potential participation in vesicular transport,"Annexin A6 (AnxA6), calcium‐ and membrane‐binding protein, is involved in membrane dynamics. It exists in the cell in two isoforms, AnxA6‐1 and AnxA6‐2, varying only by the VAAEIL sequence. In most cells, AnxA6‐1 predominates. A limited number of observations suggests that both isoforms differ from each other functionally. The EGF‐dependent Ca2+ influx in A431 cells is inhibited only by AnxA6‐1. Moreover, AnxA6‐2 was found to exhibit higher affinity for Ca2+. In this report we addressed the potential significance of the VAAEIL deletion in AnxA6‐2. For this purpose, we expressed AnxA6 isoform cDNAs in bacteria or mouse Balb/3T3 fibroblasts. The recombinant AnxA6‐2 was characterized by a less extended molecular shape than that of AnxA6‐1 and required a narrower [Ca2+] range to bind liposomes. Upon lowering pH in the presence of EGTA recombinant AnxA6‐2 became less hydrophobic than AnxA6‐1 as revealed by the Triton X‐114 partition. Furthermore, AnxA6‐2 revealed stronger F‐actin binding than that of AnxA6‐1. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the EGFP‐tagged AnxA6 isoforms expressed in Balb/3T3 fibroblasts relocate in a Ca2+‐ and H+‐sensitive manner to the vesicular structures in a perinuclear region or in cytosol. Cell fractionation showed that in resting conditions AnxA6‐1 is associated with early endosomes and AnxA6‐2 with late endosomes, and an increase in [Ca2+] and/or [H+] induced their opposite distribution. These findings suggest a potentially independent regulation, localization, and function of AnxA6 isoforms in Balb/3T3 fibroblasts. More generally, our findings suggest distinct functions of AnxA6 isoforms in membrane dynamics. J. Cell.

EGF,all subtypes of the pmp adhesin family are implicated in chlamydial virulence and show species-specific function,"The bacterial pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and C. pneumoniae are obligate intracellular parasites, cause a number of serious diseases, and can infect various cell types in humans. Chlamydial infections are probably initiated by binding of the bacterial outer membrane protein OmcB to host cell glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Here, we show that all nine members of the polymorphic membrane protein (Pmp) family of C. trachomatis mediate adhesion to human epithelial and endothelial cells. Importantly, exposure of infectious particles to soluble recombinant Pmps blocks subsequent infection, thus implicating an important function of the entire protein family in the infection process. Analogous experiments with pairs of recombinant Pmps or a combination of Pmp and OmcB revealed that all Pmps probably act in an adhesion pathway that is distinct from the OmcB‐GAG pathway. Finally, we provide evidence that the Pmps of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae exhibit species and tissue specificity. These findings argue for the involvement of C. trachomatis Pmps in the initial phase of infection and suggest that they may interact with a receptor other than the epidermal growth factor receptor recently identified for their counterparts in C. pneumoniae.",MAYBE,YES,YES,YES,YES,,MAYBE,NO,NO,MAYBE,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO

The expression system described allows rapid isolation of kallikrein protein from corresponding cDNA with yields of approximately 1.0 mg of purified protein from 10 g of initial cell paste. This expression system will facilitate structure/function studies of the mouse glandular kallikrein gene family and help elucidate the regions of the mature proteins responsible for the diverse catalytic behavior and growth factors interactions observed in this family of proteins.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,MAYBE,YES,YES,YES,Yes,YES
LIF,the disulfide bond arrangement of leukemia inhibitory factor: homology to oncostatin m and structural implications.,"Murine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (the fully active recombinant form produced in E. coli) was digested in the unreduced state with trypsin and Staphylococcal V8 protease in 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Disulfide-bonded peptides were identified by altered mobility on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol and subjected to amino acid sequencing. Peptides containing more than one disulfide bond were subjected to further proteolysis and disulfide-bonded subfragments identified and sequenced. The three disulfide bonds are CYS13-CYS135, CYS19-CYS132 and CYS61-164 and the first and third of these are clearly homologous to the two disulfide bonds in oncostatin M. The spatial organization of the cysteine residues in the predicted four alpha-helical bundle structure of LIF (Bazan, Neuron 7,197;1991) is compatible with these disulfide assignments.",MAYBE,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,YES,Yes,NO
LIF,a monoclonal antibody based elisa for quantitation of human leukaemia inhibitory factor.,"The authors report on the development of a new sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitation of the human cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor/human interleukin for DA cells (LIF/HILDA) with high accuracy and sensitivity (23 pg/ml), in less than 5 h and in various biological fluids. The antibodies used in this assay were raised against recombinant glycosylated LIF expressed in vivo following inoculation of recombinant vaccinia viruses, and screened with the biologically active cytokine in a flow cytometry assay using cells expressing a membrane-bound form of LIF. Furthermore, this home-made assay was compared with two commercially available ELISA kits. The results led to the conclusion that these three assays are far from being equivalent between each other, in terms of sensitivity towards non-glycosylated vs glycosylated LIF. Two major parameters must be incriminated: the glycosylation status of the LIF molecule used as the calibrator, and the binding characteristics of the monoclonal antibodies used to set up these assays toward LIF derived from Escherichia coli or from eukaryotic cells. This points out the importance of these parameters for the design of ELISAs meant for the quantitation of glycosylated cytokines in biological fluids.",MAYBE,NO,NO,YES,MAYBE,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,YES,Yes,NO
EGF,the effect of epidermal growth factor on the septic complications of acute pancreatitis.,"Bacterial translocation (BT) from the gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and other extraintestinal organs is an important source of infection in acute pancreatitis (AP). Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a peptide hormone with trophic effects on gut mucosa, has decreased intestinal mucosal injury in septic rats and decreased burn-induced BT in mice. The purpose of this study is to examine whether EGF could affect BT in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were studied. AP was induced in Group I and Group II by pressure injection of 3% taurocholate and trypsin into the biliopancreatic duct (1 ml/kg of body weight). Group III and Group IV underwent laparotomy without induction of acute pancreatitis. Group I rats received human recombinant EGF (100 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously twice daily) and Group II rats received a similar volume of 0.1% bovine serum albumin as a placebo postoperatively. Group III and Group IV received EGF and placebo, respectively. At 48 hr postoperatively, blood was drawn for culture and amylase determinations. Jejunum and ileum were obtained to measure mucosal protein content, mucosal thickness, villus height, and crypt depth. Specimens from MLN, spleen, liver, pancreas, and cecum were harvested for pathology and culture of gram positive (G+), gram negative (G-), and anaerobic bacteria. Ileal mucosal protein levels were increased significantly in Group I (1.96 +/- 0.14 mg/cm) compared to Group II (0.95 +/- 0.15 mg/cm intestinal segment) (P < 0.01). Jejunal and ileal mucosal thickness, villus height, and crypt depth in Group I were significantly increased when compared to Group II (P < 0.05). All 12 rats in Group II had BT to MLN compared to 58% (7 of 12 rats) in Group I (P < 0.05). Thirty-three percent (4 of 12 rats) had BT to distant sites such as pancreas, spleen, liver, and/or blood in Group I vs 83% (10 of 12 rats) in Group II (P < 0.05). EGF treatment minimizes intestinal damage, decreases BT to MLN and bacterial spread to distant sites, and may be beneficial in preventing septic complications in AP.",MAYBE,NO,NO,YES,NO,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO
EGF,amino-terminal charge affects the periplasmic accumulation of recombinant heregulin/egf hybrids exported using the escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase signal sequence.,"An Escherichia coli expression system that exploits the bacterial alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) signal sequence to translocate recombinant human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) to the periplasm was used to evaluate how changes in the composition and sequence of amino acids near the PhoA-hEGF junction influence the periplasmic accumulation of recombinant protein. A series of chimeric structural genes was generated by in vitro replacement of hEGF sequence with analogous segments from the EGF-like domain of human heregulin (HRG), significantly altering the electrostatic character of the amino-terminal region of the mature protein. Quantitation of HRG/EGF protein in E. coli periplasmic extracts, by RP-HPLC, showed a fourfold decrease after one of two acidic residues located in the amino-terminal region of the mature hEGF, near the PhoA junction, was replaced. An additional threefold decrease was observed when the second acidic residue was replaced with a positively charged lysine. Further extension of the amino-terminal HRG sequence, beyond the first six residues, resulted in net neutralization of a more distant EGF acidic residue with no additional effect on protein yield. The importance of having a negatively charged group in the amino-terminal region of the mature protein was confirmed when insertion of an aspartic acid near the amino-terminus of two poorly expressed hybrid protein sequences resulted in a five- to eightfold increase in their recovery from the periplasm. This study demonstrates the importance of having negatively charged residues near the fusion junction of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli using the PhoA signal sequence for protein export.",YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,Yes,YES
EGF,production of a novel recombinant tgfα-like fusion protein for use in serum-free media,"A bacterial expression system has been developed which allows for high level expression of recombinant proteins in the form of fusion proteins. This system was used to manufacture a transforming growth factor (TGF)α-like fusion protein Long TGFα for use as a supplement in serum-free culture of eukaryotic cells. The expressed fusion protein, recovered in the form of inclusion bodies, was solubilised using chaotropic agents, correctly refolded and then purified, prior to determination of its biological activity. The purified molecule, LongTGF??displayed mitogenic activity in mammalian cells. Moreover, it demonstrated a 14-fold greater EGF receptor affinity than recombinant EGF when assessed in cultured chick embryo fibroblasts. This differential affinity for EGF receptors in avian cells indicates a potential use for LongTGFα in the development of serum-free media for the production of viral vaccines in such cells.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,Yes,YES
EGF,generation of properly folded epidermal growth factor-like (egf) repeats and glycosyltransferases enables in vitro o-glycosylation.,"The epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain is an evolutionarily conserved motif found widely distributed among numerous secreted and membrane-anchored proteins, including the Notch receptors. Notch receptors include numerous EGF repeats tandemly connected in the extracellular domain. These EGF repeats must be properly folded in order for them to undergo the three different types of O-glycosylation associated with these extracellular proteins: O-fucose, O-glucose, and O-N-acetylglucosamine via glycosyltransferases POFUT1, POGLUT1, and EOGT. The O-glycosylation of the EGF repeats in the Notch receptors regulates the activation of Notch signaling and mutations in POFUT1, POGLUT1, and EOGT have been linked to specific human diseases. A large amount of EGF repeat and glycosyltransferase protein is required to construct an in vitro O-glycosylation system. Here, we describe how we prepared properly folded EGF repeats using two different bacterial expression vectors, generated recombinant glycosyltransferases, and performed in vitro O-glycosylation and subsequent product analysis by mass spectrometry. The methods described here are useful for investigating the enzymatic activities of mutated glycosyltransferases, revealing the structural basis of the O-glycosylation mechanism by co-crystallization of the glycosyltransferase-EGF repeat complexes, or identifying potential inhibitors of these glycosyltransferases.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,NO,YES,MAYBE,YES,Yes,YES

Protein isolation and purification was performed by Ni2+chromatography. rHSS was found as a homodimer under non-reducing conditions. Additionally endogenous HSS was enriched from weanling rat livers and purified by ion exchange chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies against HSS N- and C-terminus were produced. In Western blotsantibodies detected rHSS as monomer as well as homodimer from procaryontic and eucaryontic expression systems. To evaluate the influence of rHSS on proliferation potential in liver cells 3H-Thymidin, and BrdU assays were established.

EGF,effects of in vitro protein stabilizers on the overproduction of ß-lactamase in escherichia coli,"Previous work showed that the yield of soluble, secretiory recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, such as b-lactamase or human epidermal growth factor(hEGF), could be increased significantly by lowering the cultivation temperature [1]. Also, at lower temperature (20∘C), E.coli RB791, overproducing b-lactamase, produced less inclusion bodies in the periplasm. Georgiou et al. observed that the aggregation of b-lactamase was inhibited when non-metabolizable sugars, such as sucrose and raffinose, were added into the growth medium. Also four fold increases in the amount of soluble protein was observed [2]. Protein stabilizers, usually added in the storage or reaction buffers of enzymes, are generally divided into two groups; osmolytic and ionic stabilizers. Among the osmolytic stabilizing sugars, glycerol, glucose and frutose are easily metabolized by E.coli. Therefore, if these carbon sources can inhibit the protein aggregation, using these carbon sources would be a simple and convenient method to increase the yield of soluble protein during the overproduction of recombinant secretory proteins. In this paper, as an extension of efforts to increase the soluble, secretory protein yield, effects of in-vitro protein stabilizers were inverstigated on the overproduction of b-lactamase.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,YES,YES,MAYBE,YES,Yes,YES
LIF,production of recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (lif) in a mammalian cell bioreactor: a first approach,"The development of chemically well defined media is a demanding task in order to create the optimal conditions for the in-vitro stem cell (SC) proliferation and differentiation. Mammalian cell culture has become the dominant technology for the production of recombinant proteins for clinical applications due proper protein folding, assembly and post-translational modifications with superior quality and efficacy than when expressed in other hosts such as bacteria, plants and yeasts (Hacker et al. 2009). This work aims the large-scale production of recombinant human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (r-hLIF) expressed in mammalian cells in the absence of serum. LIF is a secreted globular and monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 32 to 62 kDa. It has a wide array of actions, including acting as a stimulus for platelet formation, proliferation of some hematopoietic cells, bone formation, adipocyte lipid transport, neuronal survival and formation, and acute phase production by hepatocytes (Metcalf 2003). HEK293-EBNA cells were successfully expanded in 100 mL spinner-flask at agitation rates of 80 rpm and a feeding-regime (FR) of 25% medium renewal every 24 h. Then, scale-up to a mechanically-stirred bioreactor and a working volume of 1 L with fully controlled parameters was achieved. The data presented seems to predict that considerable volume changes in the suspension culture system of HEK293 cells may have a negative effect in cellular growth leading to a decrease in cell density and an increase in the heterogeneity of cell aggregate size-distribution. Thus, a variable FR, apparently good in terms of nutrient refresh, can provide additional variables that can affect autocrine factors concentration in the bulk and, consequently, affect maximum cell density and specific productivities. Overall, this work will allow the establishment of a versatile platform for the production of a wide range of recombinant proteins to be used in stem cell culture in a cost-effective way.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,YES,YES,MAYBE,YES,Yes,YES
EGF,biosynthesis of epidermal growth factor having nonprotein amino acid residues by escherichia coli,"For development of a novel method in protein engineering, we studied the use of nonprotein amino acids, namely, amino acids other than the 20 protein-constituting amino acids. We succeeded in in vivo production of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) substituted with norleucine, an analog of methionine. In the present study we attempted production of hEGF substituted with p-fluorophenylalanine residue (pFPhe), although hEGF does not have Phe residues. We prepared two genes of mutant hEGF; Tyr22 or Tyr29 was replaced by Phe by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. To enhance incorporation of p-fluorophenyl-alanine, these mutant hEGF genes were introduced into an Escherichia coli strain auxotrophic for phenylalanine. The optimum concentration of p-fluorophenylalanine for production of pFPhe-substituted hEGFs was 50 μg/ml. By gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase and ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, we succeeded in purification of pFPhe-substituted hEGFs. Fluorine substitution of the aromatic ring of each Phe residue probably induces a conformational change of hEGF.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,MAYBE,YES,MAYBE,YES,Yes,YES

Long EGF, a human EGF with a 53 amino acid N-terminal fusion partner, and LR3IGF-I, a human IGF-I with an arginine in place of glutamate at position 3 and a 13-residue N-terminal fusion partner, have been developed and tested in serum-free cell culture. Advantages of this approach are a substantially higher yield and improved economy of recombinant peptide production compared to making the native growth factors, and significantly higher potency in cell culture, particularly in the case of LR3IGF-I. Combinations of these growth factor analogs are potently synergistic and provide an important tool for formulating serum-free media.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,MAYBE,YES,YES,YES,Yes,YES

EGF,generation of lactococcus lactis capable of coexpressing epidermal growth factor and trefoil factor to enhance in vitro wound healing,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) are peptides that actively support the restitution and repair of mucosal epithelial barriers. Previous studies have shown that TFF3 enhanced EGF effect in wound healing, suggesting that the combined application of the two factors may be advantageous in clinical tissue repair. Expression of multiple proteins in a single host is a desirable approach in a biotechnological process, allowing to reduce cost and increase production efficiency. The aim of the present study was to study the feasibility of coexpressing EGF and TFF3 in food grade bacteria, Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis). Using an expression construct allowing simultaneous translation of two separate recombinant peptides, we generated a L. lactis that coexpressed and secreted EGF and TFF3 dually (LL-ET). Western blot analysis revealed that LL-ET secreted 45–54 % more total recombinant peptides (EGF+TFF3) per flask fermentation and 21–37 % more total recombinant proteins in bioreactor fermentation compared to their single factor expressing L. lactis counterparts (LL-EGF and LL-TFF3, respectively). The resulted recombinant EGF and TFF3 showed enhancement in wound healing activity in vitro. Our data suggest that the dual expression and secretion of EGF and TFF3 by L. lactis effectively accelerated cell migration, demonstrating potential future oral application of L. lactisfermentation product containing dual factors or a cocktail of factors to potentially treat intestinal damage and inflammation.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,YES,YES,MAYBE,YES,Yes,YES
EGF,recombinant immunotoxins and retargeted killer cells: employing engineered antibody fragments for tumor-specific targeting of cytotoxic effectors,"Over the past years, monoclonal antibodies have attracted enormous interest as targeted therapeutics, and a number of such reagents are in clinical use. However, responses could not be achieved in all patients with tumors expressing high levels of the respective target antigens, suggesting that other factors such as limited recruitment of endogenous immune effector mechanisms can also influence treatment outcome. This justifies the search for alternative, potentially more effective reagents. Antibody-toxins and cytolytic effector cells genetically modified to carry antibody-based receptors on the surface, represent such tailor-made targeting vehicles with the potential of improved tumor localization and enhanced efficacy. In this way, advances in recombinant antibody technology have made it possible to circumvent problems inherent in chemical coupling of antibodies and toxins, and have allowed construction via gene fusion of recombinant molecules which combine antibody-mediated recognition of tumor cells with specific delivery of potent protein toxins of bacterial or plant origin. Likewise, recombinant antibody fragments provide the basis for the construction of chimeric antigen receptors that, upon expression in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells, link antibody-mediated recognition of tumor antigens with these effector cells’ potent cytolytic activities, thereby making them promising cellular therapeutics for adoptive cancer therapy. Here, general principles for the derivation of cytotoxic proteins and effector cells with antibody-dependent tumor specificity are summarized, and current strategies to employ these molecules and cells for directed cancer therapy are discussed, focusing mainly on the tumor-associated antigens epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the closely related ErbB2 (HER2) as targets.",MAYBE,NO,NO,YES,NO,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,YES,Yes,NO
EGF,"different properties of three isoforms (α, β, and γ) of transcription factor ap-2 in the expression of human keratinocyte genes","The transcription factor AP-2/promoter system is essential for gene expression associated with ectodermal development, particularly in the neural crest and skin. Three AP-2 isoforms, α, β, and γ, exhibit a highly homologous structure, but their functions are considered to be different. Here, we report on the role of each AP-2 isoform in complex keratinocyte biology including proliferation, differentiation, and carcinogenesis. The expression of AP-2 was investigated immunohistochemically in serial skin sections from normal and psoriatic skin, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). AP-2α was present only in the nuclei of normal basal keratinocytes, but was significantly increased in lesional proliferating keratinocytes of both diseases. AP-2β was completely absent from all skin samples except dermal sweat glands, whereas AP-2γ was present homogeneously throughout the epidermis in normal and psoriatic skin as well as in the SCC lesion. Their restricted expression patterns correlated with in vitro DNA binding assays using selective keratinocyte gene promoters and three recombinant AP-2 isoforms generated bacterially as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Epidermal growth factor receptor and basal keratin K14 promoters bound to AP-2α and AP-2γ with similar affinities, whereas suprabasal keratin K1, type I transglutaminase, and involucrin promoters predominantly bound to AP-2γ rather than AP-2α. In contrast, AP-2β did not bind to any of the five promoters despite specific binding to the AP-2 consensus probe. These results suggest that AP-2α is closely associated with keratinocyte proliferation and/or carcinogenesis rather than differentiation, while AP-2γ is ubiquitous in all stages of keratinocyte biology. Taken together, three AP-2 isoforms perform unique roles in the spatial and temporal expression of human keratinocyte-related genes, thereby maintaining epidermal homeostasis.

EGF,"production, expression, and function of dual-specific monoclonal antibodies in a single plant","Recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which can be applied to treat various cancers, are primarily produced using mammalian, insect, and bacteria cell culture systems. Plant expression systems have also been developed to produce antibodies. Plant expression systems present several advantages, including a lack of human pathogenic agents, efficient production costs, and easy large-scale production. In this study, we generated a transgenic plant expressing anti-colorectal cancer large single chain (LSC) CO17-1AK and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) VHH-FcK mAbs by cross-pollinating plants expressing LSC CO17-1AK and anti-HER2 VHH-FcK, respectively. F1siblings expressing both LSC CO17-1AK and anti-HER2 VHH-FcK were screened using polymerase chain reaction and Western-blot analyses. The cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cell ELISA) confirmed the binding of LSC CO17-1AK and anti-HER2 VHH-FcK to target proteins in the SW620 human colorectal cancer and the SKBR-3 human breast cancer cell lines, respectively. The wound healing assay confirmed the inhibitory activity of both antibodies against SW620 and SKBR-3 cell migration, respectively. In conclusion, both LSC CO17-1AK mAb and anti-HER2 VHH-FcK can be produced in a single plant, achieve binding activities to SW620 and SKBR-3 cancer cells, and inhibitory activity against SW620 and SKBR-3 cell migration similar to their parental antibodies, respectively.",YES,,YES,YES,YES,,YES,MAYBE,YES,YES,YES,Yes,YES
EGF,bifunctional recombinant proteins in cancer therapy: cell penetrating peptide aptamers as inhibitors of growth factor signaling,"The major aim of molecular cancer research is the development of new therapeutic strategies and compounds that target directly the genetic and biochemical causes of malignant transformation. Therapeutic genes, antibodies and their derivatives, but also small molecular weight compounds, have been used for this purpose. Small peptides might be able to complement these agents because of their ability to recognize specific protein domains and thus to interfere with enzymatic functions or protein-protein interactions. A variation of the yeast-two-hybrid procedure allows to select specifically binding peptides, so called peptide aptamers, from a peptide library of high complexity. This selection procedure can be adapted to any protein or protein fragment as a bait construct and selects for the intracellular interaction between the bait of choice and the peptide aptamer prey. Peptide aptamers thus selected can be cloned, provided with a protein transduction domain, expressed in bacteria and introduced into cancer cells. There they might disrupt protein-protein interactions crucial for cancer cell growth or survival. We introduce an example in which the Stat3 arm of EGF receptor signaling is selectively inhibited by a peptide aptamer and causes the growth arrest of EGF receptor-dependent tumor cells.

FGF1,recombinant fibroblast growth factor-1 promotes intimal hyperplasia and angiogenesis in arteries in vivo,"THE prototype members of the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family1–6, acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), are among the growth factors that act directly on vascular cells to induce endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. In vivo, the role of the FGF prototypes in vascular pathology has been difficult to determine. We report here the introduction, by direct gene transfer into porcine arteries, of a eukaryotic expression vector encoding a secreted form of FGF-1. This somatic transgenic model defines gene function in the arterial wall in vivo. FGF-1 expression induced intimal thickening in porcine arteries 21 days after gene transfer, in contrast to control arteries transduced with an Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene. Where there was substantial intimal hyperplasia, neocapillary formation was detected in the expanded intima. These findings suggest that FGF-1 induces intimal hyperplasia in the arterial wall in vivo and, through its ability to stimulate angiogenesis in the neointima, FGF-1 could stimulate neovascularization of atherosclerotic plaques.

EGF,"the secreted salmonella dublin phosphoinositide phosphatase, sopb, localizes to ptdins(3)p-containing endosomes and perturbs normal endosome to lysosome trafficking.","Invasion and survival in mammalian cells by Salmonella enterica is mediated by bacterial proteins that are delivered to the host cell cytoplasm by type III secretion systems. One of these proteins, SopB/SigD, is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that can hydrolyse a number of substrates in vitro including PtdIns(3,5)P2. These substrates are, however, likely to be restricted in vivo by the localization of SopB, as different phosphoinositides have distinct spatial distributions in mammalian cells. In the present study, we show that heterologously expressed SopB localizes almost exclusively to endosomes containing the lipid PtdIns(3)P, and on which ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) proteins assemble. Furthermore, we present evidence that SopB can inhibit trafficking of activated epidermal growth factor receptor to the lysosome. These results provide further evidence that PtdIns(3,5)P2, a lipid involved in endosomal maturation, may be a relevant in vivo substrate of SopB. We hypothesize that reduction of PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels in cells by the action of SopB may perturb the function of a subset of ESCRT proteins that have previously been shown to bind to this lipid.",NO,,NO,YES,NO,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,YES,No,NO

Activation of MEK1 by MEKK-C is accompanied by phosphorylation of S218 and S222, which are also phosphorylated by the protein kinases c-Mos and Raf-1. MEKK1 has been implicated in regulation of a parallel but distinct cascade that leads to phosphorylation of N-terminal sites on c-Jun; thus, its role in the MAP kinase pathway has been questioned. However, in addition to its capacity to phosphorylate MEK1 in vitro, MEKK-C interacts with MEK1 in the two-hybrid system, and expression of mouse MEKK1 or MEKK-C in mammalian cells causes constitutive activation of both MEK1 and MEK2. Neither cotransfected nor endogenous ERK2 is highly activated by MEKK1 compared to its stimulation by epidermal growth factor in spite of significant activation of endogenous MEK.

Using in vitro and in vivo models of shigellosis, we found that S. flexneri induces the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) through the nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Congruently, abrogation of NOD2 or EGFR compromises the ability of S. flexneri to induce IDO1 expression. We observed that the loss of IDO1 function in vivo exacerbates shigellosis by skewing the inflammatory cytokine response, disrupting colon epithelial barrier integrity and consequently limiting the host life-span. Interestingly, administration of recombinant EGF rescued mice from IDO1 inhibition-driven aggravated shigellosis by restoring the cytokine balance and subsequently restricting bacterial growth. This is the first study that underscores the direct implication of the NOD2-EGFR axis in IDO1 production and its crucial homeostatic contributions during shigellosis.

In contrast, fusion proteins containing the two individual EGF‐like modules reacted poorly with the natural antibodies and their proteins, as well as a simple mixture of them, induced low levels of anti‐parasite antibodies despite producing high levels of anti‐GST antibody. Antibodies raised to the recombinant proteins recognized the 230 kDa MSP‐1. Groups of mice immunized with the different recombinant proteins were challenged with parasites: protection was observed in the group which had received the recombinant protein containing both modules but not in those groups immunized with the individual modules, either alone or as a mixture. These results suggest that there are important structural determinants formed by the two modules together, which are not present in either of the individual domains alone, and which are responsible for the immunogenicity of the protein or are the target of protective antibodies.",MAYBE,No access,,YES,YES,MAYBE,MAYBE,YES,YES,MAYBE,YES,Yes,YES
EGF,obtaining recombinant extracellular fragments of gpr161 receptor,"The GPR161 is a receptor of the GPCR family and identified as a prognostic biomarker for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC characterized by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (Her2), early recurrence and poor prognosis. The GPR161 is an important regulator of the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. However, anti-GPCR receptor drugs are rarely used in the treatment of cancer, despite evidence of receptor involvement in various aspects of cancer development. Upon receipt of monoclonal antibodies, the success of the study is associated with the presence in sufficient quantities of pure antigen preparations. Recently, gene synthesis under de novo conditions has become a powerful tool in biotechnology. A number of methods have been described, representing thermodynamic balanced methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This paper presents the results of gene synthesis and the preparation of a recombinant extracellular fragment of the receptor. 
To obtain a recombinant protein, an area located outside the cell membrane between the 4th and 5th helix of the receptor was selected. A genetic construct based on the pET32 vector carrying the extracellular fragment of the human GPR161 receptor has been developed and obtained. Strain Escherichia coli BL21/pET32/TM4-5GPR161 producing recombinant extracellular fragment rTM4-5 GPR161 was obtained. The conditions for the isolation and purification of recombinant protein were determined, and its immunogenic properties were studied.

EGF,cellular hyperplasia in rats following continuous intravenous infusion of recombinant human epidermal growth factor,"In this study, we determined in vivo morphologic effects of continuous intravenous infusion of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) in adult Wistar rats. The EGF used consisted of the amino acid residues 1-48 of the human 53-amino-acid EGF molecule, purified from transfected Escherichia coli. Doses of 25, 100, or 250 μg/kg body weight were administered using Harvard digital syringe infusion pumps for 4 weeks. At necropsy, the submandibular salivary glands, Harderian glands, liver, kidneys (females only), and ovaries were enlarged and urinary bladders were thickened in 100- and 250-μg/kg rats. Numerous tissues of the 100- and 250-μg/kg rats contained hyperplastic epithelial cells, and selected organs also had mesenchymal cell proliferation. Epithelial proliferation was most pronounced in the trachea, nasal cavity, nasolacrimal duct, tongue, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary tract, salivary gland ducts, and Harderian gland. Periportal hepatocytes were hypertrophic, correlating with increased liver weight. In addition, mesenchymal cell proliferation was evident in the gastric mucosa lamina propria and in heart valves in 100- and 250-μg/kg rats. Increased ovarian weight correlated with increased number and size of corpora lutea and an increased incidence of luteal cysts. Continuous systemic exposure of adult Wistar rats to high doses of EGF resulted in generalized epithelial hyperplasia and tissue-selective mesenchymal proliferation.",MAYBE,NO,NO,YES,NO,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,YES,MAYBE,NO

EGF,clinical trials with intracerebral convection-enhanced delivery of targeted toxins in malignant glioma.,"Currently used targeted toxins are recombinant molecules specifically binding to surface receptors overexpressed on tumor cells. These recombinant proteins consist of a tumor-selective ligand coupled to a truncated peptide toxin. Ligands may bind to tumor-associated molecules with receptor signaling properties, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, transferrin receptor, and interleukin-13 or interleukin-4 receptors. The toxin part of the molecule in all clinically used toxins is a modified bacterial polypeptide fused to one of the above ligands. Targeted toxins are very effective against tumor cells resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. They are far more potent than any known chemotherapy drug. Targeted toxins have shown an acceptable profile of toxicity and safety in early clinical studies and have demonstrated some evidence for tumor response. Currently, phase 3 trials with some targeted toxins are underway and final results are still pending. This review summarizes the study protocols and key findings of the most important clinical studies with targeted toxins in malignant glioma patients. It offers in addition an outlook into future areas of development of targeted toxins, such as improved delivery modes and non-invasive imaging of toxin distribution.",NO,NO,NO,YES,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,YES,NO,MAYBE,NO,Yes,NO
EGF,therapeutic effect of lactiplantibacillus plantarun hfy11 isolated from naturally fermented yak yogurt on lincomycin hydrochloride–induced diarrhea in mice,"This study aimed to observe the therapeutic effect of Lactiplantibacillus plantarun HFY11 (LP-HFY11) on lincomycin hydrochloride-induced diarrhea in mice. The results showed that LP-HFY11 alleviated weight loss and intestinal and colon tissue lesions caused by diarrhea. The serum assay showed that LP-HFY11 decreased interleukin 17A (IL-17A), IL-6, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and malondialdehyde levels and increased total antioxidant capacity in mice with diarrhea. LP-HFY11 also downregulated the mRNA expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and upregulated the expression of recombinant sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) and NHE4 in the colon tissues of mice with diarrhea. In conclusion, the study showed that LP-HFY11 could effectively inhibit diarrhea, and the effect was better than that of the drug Bifidobacterium tetragenous viable bacteria tablets (Bifidobacterium-TVBT).",NO,NO,NO,Maybe,NO,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO
EGF,using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids to study and modify epithelial cell protection against salmonella and other pathogens.,"The intestinal 'organoid' (iHO) system, wherein 3-D structures representative of the epithelial lining of the human gut can be produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and maintained in culture, provides an exciting opportunity to facilitate the modeling of the epithelial response to enteric infections. In vivo, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play a key role in regulating intestinal homeostasis and may directly inhibit pathogens, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully elucidated. The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) has been shown to play a role in the maintenance and defense of the gut epithelial barrier, including inducing a release of antimicrobial peptides and chemokines in response to infection. We describe the differentiation of healthy control hiPSCs into iHOs via the addition of specific cytokine combinations to their culture medium before embedding them into a basement membrane matrix-based prointestinal culture system. Once embedded, the iHOs are grown in media supplemented with Noggin, R-spondin-1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), CHIR99021, prostaglandin E2, and Y-27632 dihydrochloride monohydrate. Weekly passages by manual disruption of the iHO ultrastructure lead to the formation of budded iHOs, with some exhibiting a crypt/villus structure. All iHOs demonstrate a differentiated epithelium consisting of goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, and polarized enterocytes, which can be confirmed via immunostaining for specific markers of each cell subset, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and quantitative PCR (qPCR). To model infection, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 are microinjected into the lumen of the iHOs and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, and a modified gentamicin protection assay is performed to identify the levels of intracellular bacterial invasion. Some iHOs are also pretreated with recombinant human IL-22 (rhIL-22) prior to infection to establish whether this cytokine is protective against Salmonella infection.",NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,,MAYBE,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO,MAYBE,NO
FGF1,exploration of growth factors that regulate mucosal hyperplasia in bacterial otitis media,"Otitis media is one of the most common childhood infections and the leading cause of visits to physicians in the pediatric population. Although most cases of otitis media are treated without diffi culty, up to 20% of children progress to persistent or recurrent acute otitis media or chronic otitis media. These conditions have presented major therapeutic challenges in the management of the disease. Furthermore, they may lead to many long-term complications, including irreversible middle ear disease, conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, impaired speech and language development, impaired academic achievement. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the middle ear infl ammatory response during otitis media may direct us toward potential therapies for this disease. Hyperplasia of the middle ear mucosa is an important component of otitis media, involving substantial cell proliferation and differentiation. Hyperplasia contributes to the deleterious sequelae of otitis media, including the production of mucous secretions of middle ear effusions, fi brosis and other permanent damage that can occur in repeated and/or chronic otitis media. The regulation of mucosal hyperplasia in the middle ear is, therefore, of great clinical signifi cance. The growth and differentiation of dividing cells are controlled in part by peptide growth factors, these endogenous, biologically active substances are constructed locally and released in a paracrine fashion at their site of action. There are only a few previous investigations that tested several growth factors that could be associated with the proliferation and differentiation of the middle ear mucosa during otitis media, such as Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Betacellulin, and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2 (FGF 1 and FGF 2). Furthermore there is no study that investigated this matter comprehensively. Following these data, in this study, we explored other growth factors that are modulated during bacterial otitis media and may regulate mucosal hyperplasia of middle ear in a comprehensive manner. Expression of selected genes involved in mucosal growth was evaluated by whole-genome DNA microarray techneque. Mice middle ear mucosae were harvested at several time points from 3 hour to 7 days after inoculation of H. infl uenzae or saline and analyzed. We identified 7 factors that their mRNA were highly expressed at early point after bacterial inoculation, along with the development of mucosal hyperplasia; Amphiregulin, Epiregulin, HB-EGF (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor), Cxcl-1, GDF-15, Activin A, LIF. To test their ability to infl uence mucosal hyperplasia, we used in vitro mucosal explant model. We cultured mucosal explant from rat middle ear mucosa and add recombinant growth factors into the culture media at several different concentrations (1–100 ng/ml). We measured the area of mucosal explants at day 10. Of those seven growth factors, HB-EGF had stimulatory effect on growth of middle ear mucosal explants. In the future, the mechanisms by which HB-EGF stimulate mucosal hyperplasia will be investigated further.

EGF,[expression and characterization of porcine epidermal growth factor in lactobacillus plantarum].,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an epithelial cell growth factor that can stimulate intestinal development, repair the damage of epidermal cells as well as reduce the incidence of pathogen infection and diarrhea. In order to produce a recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) expressing porcine epidermal growth factor (pEGF), we constructed a recombinant vector stably expressing pEGF in L. plantarum strains. First, L. plantarum strain Lp-1 was isolated from intestinal contents of piglets. Then the functional domain of pEGF, M6 precursor protein signal peptide (SP) and super strong constitutive promoter (SCP) were connected with the backbone plasmid pIAβ8 to construct the recombinant vector that was transformed into Lp-1 by electroporation. Afterwards, pEGF was expressed in Lp-1 and detected by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and ELISA. After orally irrigated early-weaned BALB/c mice with the recombinant L. plantarum every morning and late afternoon for 10 consecutive days, body weight, villous height and crypt depth in the intestine were measured to examine the influence of the recombinant bacteria on the intestinal development of early-weaned mice in vivo. Finally, the results of our experiments demonstrated that pEGF was successfully expressed in Lp-1 and the molecular weight of pEGF was 6 kDa. In addition, the recombinant pEGF can enhanced the daily gain and exerted significance influence (P < 0.05) to the small intestinal morphology of early-weaned BALB/c mice. In conclusion, pEGF could be expressed in L. plantarum and the recombinant pEGF possesses good biological activity.",MAYBE,Article in Chinese - Not accessible,,,Yes,,YES,MAYBE,YES,MAYBE,YES,,YES
EGF,[preparation and identification of single-chain fragment variable against epidermal growth factor receptor 3].,"Objective To express, purify and identify the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) against human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3). Methods We searched NCBI for the light chain sequence and heavy chain sequence of anti-HER3 mAb LJM716 to construct the gene of scFv against HER3. The recombinant expression vector pGAPZαA-anit-HER3-scFv was constructed using the constitutive expression vector pGAPZαA and then electro-transformed into Pichia Pastoris X-33 to screen the strains with high expression of the protein of interest. After shaking flask fermentation, the supernatant was purified by hydrophobic chromatography and metal ion affinity chromatography. The purified product was identified by Western blotting and ELISA. Results The anti-HER3-scFv gene was successfully constructed and the strains with high expression of anti-HER3-scFv were obtained. The anti-HER3-scFv was purified to a purity of more than 95% by two-step chromatography, and the purified yield was 192 mg/L. Western blotting showed that the anti-HER3-scFv was correctly expressed and ELISA indicated that anti-HER3-scFv could specifically recognize HER3.

LIF,ciliary neurotrophic factor prevents degeneration of adult rat substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons in vivo ( neuronal death / axotomy / trophic factor / tyrosine hydroxylase / parkinson disease ),"We have investigated the neuroprotective effects of recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) for injured dopaminergic neurons of the adult rat substantia nigra compacta. Fourteen days after a unilateral ansetion of the nigrostriatal pathway two-thirds of the neurons (identiffed by retograde labeling) had degenerated. In sharp contrast, 73% (a few cases, >90%) of this ceil loss was prevented by continuous infusion of CNTF close to the injured neurons. However, CNTF did not prevent the disappearance of the transmitter-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Thus, CNTF has potent neurotrophic effects for injured adult rat dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons, whose degeneration plays a major causative role in Parkinson disease. During development of the peripheral nervous system, neurons become dependent for their survival and/or function on neurotrophic factors, specialized proteins that can be supplied by the innervation territory (1, 2). The importance of such factors for the maintenance of mature as well as injured adult neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) has also been recognized, in particular the relationship between nerve growth factor (NGF) and cholinergic basal forebrain neurons (3, 4). Injury of the CNS often causes degeneration of the axotomized neurons, resulting in their atrophy or death. It is still unresolved whether such degenerative changes are caused primarily by the interruption of target-derived trophic support or the injury itself (5), but they can largely be prevented by administration (substitution) of exogenous trophic factors (3, 4). Another type of trophic factor, named ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), was shown in vitro to have several biological activities for neurons and glial cells, including promotion of survival by several types of developing peripheral nervous system and CNS neurons (6-11). CNTF has recently been purified, cloned, and sequenced and the human gene has been expressed in bacteria and insect cells to produce recombinant protein in large enough quantities for in vivo investigations (12-17). On the basis of its amino acid sequence, predicted tertiary structure, and type of receptors, CNTF is now viewed as a member of the a-helical cytokine superfamily, which includes leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and oncostatin M (18, 19). In vivo, purified CNTF can protect spinal motor neurons ofdeveloping chickens against developmental neuronal death (20, 21) and facial motor neurons ofthe neonatal rat after their axotomy (22). We have recently shown in the adult rat in vivo that CNTF can almost completely prevent the axotomyinduced degeneration ofcholinergic as well as noncholinergic medial septum neurons (23). However, although CNTF prevented reduction of cell body size and loss of the low-affinity NGF receptors in these cholinergic neurons, no protective The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

EGF,"cytotoxic activity of chimeric toxins containing the epidermal growth factor-like domain of heregulins fused to pe38kdel, a truncated recombinant form of pseudomonas exotoxin.","The EGF-like domains of heregulin alpha, beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 were fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38KDEL), which contains a modified carboxyl-terminal sequence, KDEL, that increases that toxin activity. The resulting chimeric toxins were produced in Escherichia coli, purified to near homogeneity, and shown to be cytotoxic to target cells with very high activity on HTB20, N-87 MCF-7, and HepG2 cells; high activity on A431 and MDA-MB468 cells; and low activity toward SK-OV3, L929, and KB cells. The fact that cytotoxicity did not correlate with the levels of erbB2 expression indicated that another receptor in the erb family might be involved. Accordingly, cytotoxicity assays were performed on NIH/3T3 cell lines transfected with EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4. The results indicate that the heregulin toxins target ErbB4 or possibly ErbB3 but not ErbB2.",YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,MAYBE,YES,MAYBE,YES,YES,YES
