recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy: another negative sepsis trial?,"Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by an unbalanced host response to an infection resulting in organ dysfunction.1 Sepsis is associated with activation of the coagulation system, and 30% to 60% of patients have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).2 Fulminant DIC is characterized by` activation of the coagulation system combined with an impaired function of endogenous anticoagulant mechanisms resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and concurrent hemorrhage secondary to consumption of clotting factors and platelets.3,4 Strong and bimodal interactions exist between coagulation and inflammation, wherein coagulation factors enhance inflammation and vice versa.4 Observational studies suggest a link between the severity of coagulopathy, organ dysfunction, and death in patients with sepsis. In addition, in several preclinical sepsis models, inhibition of coagulation reduces both systemic inflammation and mortality.3,4 These findings led to large randomized trials of several anticoagulant agents in patients with sepsis, most notably recombinant human activated protein C (APC), tissue factor pathway inhibitors, and antithrombin.5 None of these interventions improved survival, with the exception of APC in the PROWESS trial and those results were not upheld by subsequent trials.5 In this issue of JAMA, Vincent and colleagues report the long-awaited results of the SCARLET (Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin) phase 3 trial.6 SCARLET was designed to determine the effect of another anticoagulant, soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin (ART-123), on 28-day mortality in patients with sepsisassociated coagulopathy and concomitant cardiovascular failure, respiratory failure, or both. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the primary end point of 28-day allcause mortality, raising the question of why the study was conducted given prior results with other anticoagulants. The answer is somewhat nuanced, but, in short, thrombomodulin has a different mode of action that offers important theoretical advantages. The soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin evaluated in this study is composed of the extracellular portion of the transmembrane receptor thrombomodulin, which entails a C-type lectin domain and a region with 6 epidermal growth factor–like repeats.7 The epidermal growth factor–like repeats express a high-affinity binding site for the central coagulation protease thrombin. Thrombin complexed with thrombomodulin cannot cleave fibrinogen or activate factor V or factor XIII but rather accelerates the conversion from protein C to APC, a potent anticoagulant by virtue of its capacity to inactivate clotting factors Va and VIIIa.7 Thus, soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin has 2 anticoagulant modes of action: direct, through inhibition of the procoagulant activity of thrombin, and indirect by promoting protein C activation. In addition, after binding by thrombomodulin, thrombin is unable to cleave protease-activated receptor-1 or -3 on cells, thereby losing its proinflammatory properties. Thrombin-thrombomodulin also accelerates the activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, which inhibits fibrinolysis and inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a.7 Independent of thrombin binding, the C-type lectin-like domain of thrombomodulin has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects, including inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and nuclear factor-κ activation, impediment of adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, and inhibition of high-mobility group box 1 protein, an alarmin implicated in sepsis pathogenesis.7 The C-type lectin domain can also impede the binding of lipopolysaccharide, the proinflammatory component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, to its receptor CD14, thereby mitigating cell activation. Thus, thrombomodulin has multiple anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects that could, theoretically, be beneficial in patients with sepsis. Consistently, preclinical studies have documented favorable effects of soluble thrombomodulin in experimental sepsis associated with improvements of coagulation abnormalities, inflammation, and organ dysfunction.8 The first clinical indication that recombinant thrombomodulin might be a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with sepsis came from a phase 3 trial conducted in Japan of 227 patients with DIC secondary to hematologic malignancy or infection.9 In this study, the effects of recombinant thrombomodulin were compared with heparin using resolution of DIC as a primary end point.9 DIC was resolved in 66.1% of patients in the recombinant thrombomodulin group compared with 49.9% of patients in the heparin group, but there was no effect on the secondary end point of mortality (21.9% vs 25.7%). These data led to the registration of recombinant thrombomodulin (ART-123) for the Related article Opinion",NO,NO,NO,NO
targeting tumor cells via egf receptors: selective toxicity of an hbegf‐toxin fusion protein,"Over‐expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of numerous solid tumors, thus providing a means of selectively targeting therapeutic agents. Heparin‐binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF) binds to EGFRs with high affinity and to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in increased mitogenic potential compared to other EGF family members. We have investigated the feasibility of using HBEGF to selectively deliver a cytotoxic protein into EGFR‐expressing tumor cells.<0B> <0R>Recombinant fusion proteins consisting of mature human HBEGF fused to the plant ribosome‐inactivating protein saporin (SAP) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified HBEGF‐SAP chimeras inhibited protein synthesis in a cell‐free assay and competed with EGF for binding to receptors on intact cells. A construct with a 22‐amino‐acid flexible linker (L22) between the HBEGF and SAP moieties exhibited an affinity for the EGFR that was comparable to that of HBEGF. The sensitivity to HBEGF‐L22‐SAP was determined for a variety of human tumor cell lines, including the 60 cell lines comprising the National Cancer Institute Anticancer Drug Screen. HBEGF‐L22‐SAP was cytotoxicin vitro to a variety of EGFR‐bearing cell lines and inhibited growth of EGFR‐over‐expressing human breast carcinoma cellsin vivo. In contrast, the fusion protein had no effect on small‐cell lung carcinoma cells, which are EGFR‐deficient. Our results demonstrate that fusion proteins composed of HBEGF and SAP exhibit targeting specificity and cytotoxicity that may be of therapeutic value in treating a variety of EGFR‐bearing malignancies.

ras effector loop mutations that dissociate p120gap and neurofibromin interactions,"ras proteins are positively regulated by nucleotide exchange factors and negatively regulated by GTPase‐activating proteins (GAPs). Two GAPs have been found in mammalian cells, p120GAP and neurofibromin, the product of the type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene. A library of substitutions in the effector loop region of ras in an Escherichia coli plasmid expression system was screened for c‐Ha‐ras species with altered GAP interactions. Several substitutions preferentially disrupted the interaction of ras with p120GAP as compared with the interaction with the recombinant GAP‐related domain of neurofibromin (NF1‐GRD). The most extreme example, Tyr32His, encoded a ras species that was unaffected by p120GAP but was stimulated normally by NF1‐GRD. Tyr32His was weakly transforming in Rat2 cells. Tyr32His ras was primarily GDP‐bound in quiescent Rat2 cells, although it rapidly associated with GTP after treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor. These results show that the NF1 product has less stringent requirements than p120GAP for ras effector domain structure and that negative regulation of ras can be achieved in rat fibroblasts by the product of NF1. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",YES,YES,YES,NO
the molecular basis of touch sensation as modeled in caenorhabditis elegans,"One of the looming mysteries in signal transduction today is the question of how mechanical signals, such as pressure or stretch, are sensed. Elegant electrophysiological studies in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals support that mechanotransduction can be mediated by ion channels that gate in response to mechanical stimuli. Despite the importance of the molecular identification of these ion channels for elaborating mechanisms of mechanotransduction, genes encoding mechanosensitive ion channels eluded cloning efforts for a long time. Breakthroughs in the understanding of mechanosensitive channels have come from genetic analyses of touch sensation in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, screens for touch-insensitive mutants identified two genes, mec-4 and mec-10, that encode channel subunits implicated in touch sensation and are postulated to be the core of a mechanotransducing ion channel complex. mec-4 and mec-10 encode proteins with similarity to subunits of the mammalian amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na channel (ENaC) that mediates sodium reabsorption in the kidney and lung. mec-4 is expressed exclusively in six neurons that laser ablation studies have identified as gentle-touch receptors, and mec-10 is expressed in these six neurons plus two pairs of touch receptors that are thought to sense harsher touch. The same genetic screens that identified mec-4 and mec-10 identified other genes required for normal touch sensation in the nematode. MEC-5, a novel collagen, and MEC-9, a protein that includes multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitor repeats and EGF repeats, are extracellular matrix proteins that may interact with MEC-4/MEC-10 channel subunits on the extracellular side of the neuron to help exert gating tension on the channel. Inside the touch receptor, a specialized cytoskeleton is assembled that features 15-protofilament microtubules composed of MEC-12 a-tubulin and MEC-7 b-tubulin subunits. This cytoskeleton may be linked to tether MEC-4/MEC-10 on the intracellular side. When a mutant hyperactivated MEC-4(d) subunit is heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, voltage-independent Na currents are produced that can be modulated in both amplitude and properties by two other proteins also identified by genetic screens as required for touch transduction: MEC-2, a stomatin-like protein, and Transduction Channels in Sensory Cells.

glycoprotein oligosaccharides as recognition structures.,"A series of observations--the pronounced changes in the expression and distribution of oligosaccharide antigens during embryonic development, cell differentiation and oncogenesis, the prominence of these changing structures (oncodevelopmental antigens) on the receptor for epidermal growth factor, and the stimulation of receptor autophosphorylation following their perturbation with antibodies--has suggested that the oligosaccharides of growth factor receptors and complementary lectins may be intimately involved in molecular recognition events in growth and differentiation processes. For elucidating oligosaccharide recognition by diverse cellular and secreted proteins and microbial adhesins, a new technique has been developed which involves the overlay of immobilized oligosaccharide probes (neoglycolipids) derived from glycoproteins and other sources. New insights have been gained into carbohydrate recognition by several mammalian lectins, and a novel receptor system has been discovered in Escherichia coli isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. This new technique seems ideal for elucidating oligosaccharide recognition in diverse biological settings, and for 'quality control' of the sugar chains of recombinant glycoproteins engineered for the purpose of administration to man.",NO,,YES,NO
engineered multifunctional artificial dermis for infected burn wound healing,"Burn wound healing is a dynamic and interconnected process, with the complex status of the extracellular matrix (ECM) potentially leading to bacterial infections, drug resistance, or even fatality. However, it remains a grand challenge to assemble a skin‐like material showing similar biological properties as healthy ECM to accelerate burn healing. In this study, the ECM composition is closely mimicked and adaptive multifunctional artificial dermis is developed by leveraging Ag─S bonds, supramolecular interactions among recombinant proteins, Ag+, and hyaluronic acid (HA). The artificial dermis exhibits long‐lasting broad‐spectrum antibacterial activity, achieved though controlled Ag+ release via Ag─S bonds, supramolecular interactions, and recombinant protein‐guided multi‐level assembly, reaching a steady plateau of 83.7% in the later stage. It is found that inflammation is reduced by downregulating IL‐6 and TGF‐β expression. Furthermore, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) within the recombinant proteins stimulates Col1α, ELN, and CD31 upregulation, facilitating ECM remodeling. These adaptive multifunctional artificial dermis effectively address wound infections, accelerate collagen deposition, promote re‐epithelialization, and enhance angiogenesis in infected wounds, highlighting their potential to revolutionize burn wound treatment and offering a promising avenue to holistic care.",MAYBE,YES,YES,NO
multifunctional double‐layer and dual drug‐loaded microneedle patch promotes diabetic wound healing,"Chronic nonhealing diabetic wounds are a serious complication of diabetes, with a high morbidity rate that can cause disability or death. The long period of inflammation and dysfunctional angiogenesis are the main reasons for wound‐healing difficulty in diabetes. In this study, a multifunctional double‐layer microneedle (DMN) is constructed to control infection and promote angiogenesis, meeting the multiple demands of the healing process of a diabetic wound. The double‐layer microneedle is consisted in a hyaluronic acid substrate and a mixture of carboxymethyl chitosan and gelatin as the tip. The antibacterial drug tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) is loaded into the substrate of the microneedle to achieve rapid sterilization and promote resistance to external bacterial infections. The microneedle tip loaded with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rh‐EGF) is inserted into the skin, in response to gelatinase produced by resident microbe and disassociate to achieve the enzymatic response release. The double‐layer drug‐loaded microneedles (DMN@TH/rh‐EGF) have antibacterial and antioxidant effects, and promote cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro. In an in vivo diabetic wound model, using rats, the DMN@TH/rh‐EGF patch is able to inhibit inflammation, promote angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration during the wound healing process, promoting its healing.",MAYBE,NO,NO,NO
a mathematical description of recombinant yeast,"A model was formulated to examine specific experimental data of growth and heterologous product formation with recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae while incorporating available literature. The model simulated dry cell weight, glucose, ethanol, dissolved oxygen, human Epidermal Growth Factor (hEGF) production, fraction of recombinant cells, oxygen uptake rate, and carbon dioxide production rate for batch, fed batch, and hollow fiber bioreactor configurations. Nineteen differential equations, 24 analytical equations, and 48 parameters were required. Due to the lack of detailed studies needed for the ADH‐II and the TCA enzyme pool, 8 of the 48 parameters were adjustable. Simulation results are presented for verification of the model which successfully described the observed phenomena for the fermentations of S. cerevisiae strain AB103. 1 pYαEF‐25. Also presented is a statistical analysis of the model's fit and model parameter sensitivity.",YES,,YES,YES
mass production of human epidermal growth factor using fed‐batch cultures of recombinant escherichia coli,"Fed‐batch cultures of recombinant E. coli HB101 harboring expression plasmid pTRLBT1 or pTREBT1, with acetate concentration monitoring, are investigated to obtain high cell density and large amounts of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF). The expression plasmid pTRlBT1 contains a synthetic hEGF gene attached downstream of the N‐terminal fragment of the trp L gene preceded by the trp promoter. The expression plasmid pTREBT1 contains the same coding sequence attached downstream of the N‐terminal fragment of the trp E gene preceded by the trp promoter, trp L gene, and attenuator region. E. coli harboring pTREBT1 produces 0.56 mg/L hEGE and immediately degrades it. On the other hand E. coli harboring pTRLBT1 produces 6.8 mg/L hEGF and does not decompose it. Prominent inclusion bodies are observed in E. coli cells harboring pTRLBT1 using an election microscope. To Cultivate E. coli harboring pTRLBT1, a fed‐batch culture system, divided into a cell growth step and an hEGF production step, is carried out. The cells grow smoothly without acetate‐induced inhibition. Cell concentration and hEGF quantity reach the high values of 21 g/L and 60 mg/L, respectively.",YES,,YES,YES
in vivo chemoenzymatic control of n‐terminal processing in recombinant human epidermal growth factor,"Protein synthesis initiates with Met in the cytosol of eukaryotes and formylmethionine (fMet) in prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles. N-terminal methionine excision (NME) is the major source of N-terminal amino acid diversity in all three life kingdoms. The excision is dictated by the nature and bulkiness of the side-chain of the second amino acid (the penultimate residue) and is catalyzed by methionylaminopeptidases (MetAPs; EC 3.4.11.18). In bacteria, Lys, Arg, Leu, Phe and Ile protect the N-terminal Met from removal, whereas Met excision is promoted by having Gly, Ala, Pro, Cys, Ser, Thr or Val as the penultimate residues (Scheme 1A). NME is an irreversible cotranslational proteolysis, and is completed before the nascent polypeptide chains are fully synthesized. It was recently estimated that between 55 and 70% of the proteins of any given proteome undergo this Met excision. The canonical amino acid, Met is recognized, activated and charged onto its cognate tRNAs by methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS). The N-formyl group from the initiator, methionine is enzymatically removed from the nascent polypeptide in bacteria. This is an essential prerequisite for the co-translational action of MetAP. E. coli MetRS exhibits remarkable flexibility in its substrate binding and tRNA charging—a fact that we and others have used for in vivo incorporation of a large number of Met analogues and Met-like amino acids (surrogates) into polypeptide sequences. The chemical diversification of Met side-chains that can be achieved in this way is quite impressive; it ranges from aliphatic, chalcogen and halogen-containing side-chains, to unsaturated chemical groups like alkenes or alkynes and other interesting bioorthogonal groups such as azides. 10] Previously, Tirrell and co-workers demonstrated nearly quantitative substitution of the Met residues in dihydrofolate reduct ACHTUNGTRENNUNGase by homopropargylglycine (Hpg). The initiator Met was also substituted, but the Hpg in the first position was not excised. Similarly, we globally replaced Met with trifluoromethionine in green fluorescent protein and discovered an efficient blockage of the N-terminal excision of trifluoro-Met when Ser was the penultimate residue. Based on these observations we reasoned that the incorporation of different Met analogues at the protein’s N-terminus would enable us to change the NME rules in recombinant proteins. We chose to study the effects of azidohomoalanine (Aha) and Hpg (Scheme 1B), whose chemically unique azido and alkyne sidechains, respectively, have recently gained great importance for bioorthogonal transformations. In order to test the catalytic efficiency of MetAP towards these analogues, we prepared a series of pentapeptides that contain Met, Hpg or Aha as N-terminal amino acids with Arg or Gly in the second position (penultimate residues). While Arg, which is a bulky penultimate residue, was expected to efficiently block excision of the N-terminal residues, Gly is the smallest amino acid and should support NME. Expectedly, the overnight incubation of Arg2 pentapeptides (Met1-Arg2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; Aha1-Arg2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; and Hpg1-Arg2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5) with recombinant E. coli MetAP yielded no cleavage of Met, Aha or Hpg from the peptides (data not shown). That means that the excision was blocked completely by having Arg in the second position. On the other hand, the excision of Met, Aha and Hpg was observed in the case of Gly2 pentapeptides (Met1-Gly2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; Aha1Gly2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5; and Hpg1-Gly2-Gln3-Leu4-Phe5). The canonical amino acid Met was fully cleaved after 10 min, but complete excision of Aha and Hpg was observed only after 100 and 250 min, respectively (Figure 1). Although Aha and Hpg are less efficiently processed than Met in Gly2 pentapepACHTUNGTRENNUNGtides, they are indeed substrates for E. coli MetAP. Nonetheless, the main differences are found in the excision kinetics. These allowed us to identify the following order of the in vitro cleavage efficiency in Gly2 pentapeptides: Met>Aha>Hpg. Interestingly, the Aha-pentapeptide was better processed by the E. coli MetAP than the Hpg-pentapeptide, but we observed the opposite with MetAP from Pyrococcus furiosus (unpub[a] L. Merkel, Dr. Yu.
